The system represents a significant architectural evolution from Assignment 1, incorporating auto-scaling capabilities, event-driven processing, and AI-powered automation.

The deployed solution addresses real-world scalability challenges by combining the reliability of managed web servers with the cost-effectiveness of serverless functions. Users upload images through a responsive web interface, triggering an automated pipeline that generates AI-powered annotations via Google Gemini API and creates optimized thumbnails—all while maintaining high availability through intelligent load balancing and auto-scaling mechanisms.

**Architectural Highlights:**

- **Hybrid Cloud Design**: Traditional web tier (EC2 Auto Scaling Group + Application Load Balancer) coupled with event-driven serverless backend (AWS Lambda + EventBridge)
- **Intelligent Scaling**: CPU-based auto-scaling policies with comprehensive load testing validation demonstrating scale-out and scale-in behavior
- **Event-Driven Processing**: S3 upload events trigger parallel Lambda execution for annotation generation and thumbnail creation, ensuring optimal user experience
- **Container-Based Serverless**: Lambda functions deployed as container images enabling complex dependency management for Google AI integration and image processing libraries
- **Unified Data Management**: Carefully designed MySQL schema supporting concurrent Lambda updates through UPSERT operations, preventing race conditions

This architecture demonstrates production-ready deployment patterns suitable for high-traffic image processing applications, emphasizing both operational excellence and cost optimization. The system successfully handles variable loads while maintaining 100% availability during scaling events, making it ideal for enterprise deployment scenarios.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The enhanced image annotation system employs a hybrid architecture that strategically separates user-facing services from automated backend processing. This section presents two complementary architectural views that demonstrate comprehensive system design and seamless integration.

### 2.1 Web Application Architecture

![Web Application Architecture](./images/Web_App%20Architecture%20Diagram.png)
*Figure 2.1: Web Application Architecture - Scalable Web Tier with High Availability*

The web application architecture delivers a robust, scalable user interface built on AWS best practices:

**Core Components:**
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Internet-facing load balancer with health checks on `/health` endpoint, distributing traffic across multiple AZs
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Dynamic scaling (Min: 1, Max: 2) with CPU-based target tracking at 20% threshold
- **EC2 Instances**: t3.micro instances running containerized Flask application with Gunicorn WSGI server
- **VPC Network**: Multi-AZ deployment (10.0.0.0/16) with public subnets for ALB and private subnets for compute resources
- **RDS MySQL**: db.t3.micro instance in private subnet with 20GB storage for metadata persistence
- **S3 Integration**: Direct upload capability to trigger serverless processing pipeline

**Security & Networking:**
- Security groups implement least-privilege access (ALB→EC2 port 5000, EC2→RDS port 3306)
- NAT Gateway provides secure outbound internet access for private subnet resources
- IAM roles (LabRole) grant necessary permissions for S3 and RDS operations

### 2.2 Serverless Architecture

![Serverless Architecture](./images/Serverless%20Architecture.png)
*Figure 2.2: Serverless Architecture - Event-Driven Processing Pipeline*

The serverless backend implements an event-driven architecture for automated image processing:

**Event Flow & Components:**
1. **S3 Event Trigger**: Image upload to `uploads/` prefix generates `ObjectCreated` event
2. **EventBridge Integration**: Default event bus receives S3 events and routes to Lambda functions
3. **Parallel Processing**: 
   - **Annotation Lambda**: Container-based function (512MB, 60s timeout) integrating Google Gemini API for AI-powered image descriptions
   - **Thumbnail Lambda**: Container-based function (256MB, 30s timeout) using Pillow library for 128x128 thumbnail generation
4. **Shared Data Layer**: Both functions update RDS database with processing status and results

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Container deployment enables complex dependency management (Google API client, Pillow)
- EventBridge decouples event source from processing functions, enabling independent scaling
- Parallel execution reduces overall processing time while maintaining system responsiveness

### 2.3 Integration Architecture & Data Flow

The system's strength lies in its seamless integration between traditional and serverless components:

**Primary Integration Points:**

1. **Event-Driven Trigger**: Web application's S3 upload action automatically initiates serverless pipeline without tight coupling
2. **Shared Data Store**: RDS serves as single source of truth, accessed by both EC2 web servers and Lambda functions using identical schema
3. **Asynchronous Status Updates**: Web frontend implements AJAX polling against RDS to provide real-time processing status without blocking user experience
4. **Unified Storage Strategy**: S3 buckets serve dual purpose - user uploads trigger processing while storing both originals and generated thumbnails

**System Benefits:**
- **Loose Coupling**: Web tier remains responsive regardless of backend processing load
- **Independent Scaling**: Each component scales based on its specific resource requirements
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failure in one component doesn't cascade to others
- **Cost Optimization**: Serverless functions only consume resources during actual processing

## 5. Auto Scaling Test Results

### 5.1 Load Testing Strategy

A comprehensive load test validated the Auto Scaling Group's responsiveness and Application Load Balancer's traffic distribution under sustained high-concurrency conditions.

**Test Configuration:**
- **Tool**: Custom Python script (`load_tester.py`) with concurrent request handling
- **Target Endpoint**: `/gallery` (most resource-intensive page with database queries and S3 pre-signed URL generation)
- **Command**: `python load_tester.py --url http://comp5349a2-WebApp-ALB-79130794.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/gallery --num-requests 4000 --concurrency 20`
- **Load Parameters**: 4,000 total requests with 20 concurrent users over 207.72 seconds
- **Success Criteria**: Trigger scale-out at 20% CPU threshold, maintain 100% availability, demonstrate scale-in behavior

### 5.2 Scale-Out Verification

**Trigger Point Analysis:**
The load test successfully elevated CPU utilization above the 20% threshold, activating the Target Tracking Scaling Policy. Figure 5.1 clearly demonstrates the correlation between CPU spike (orange line) and capacity increase (blue line) from 1 to 2 instances.
